# Omnitils
Universal reusable Python utilities for the modern human. I got tired of iterating on and re-writing the same common functionality
and design across various Python projects, so I decided to combine and curate every generalized utility function I've written
over the years into a single module.

## ‚ùì What's in it?
Mostly pretty straightforward utilities for dealing with files, schemas, properties, requests, and a variety of other common 
needs of the modern Python user. Nothing in here is going to be earth-shattering or novel, you can find dozens of Stackoverflow
articles using some of these same methodologies, apart from a handful of opinionated approaches I've taken in certain cases.

The bulk of these utilities are things beginner or intermediate Python programmers already have in their toolbelt, things you could write yourself.
However, if you develop a lot of apps and are tired of copying over the same code you've written before for a common solution, you may find
these useful.

## üíå How can I support your projects?
If you find this module useful, or any of my other apps (Proxyshop, MTG Art Downloader, Hexproof API, Scalecord, etc) feel free to subscribe 
to my [Patreon here](https://patreon.com/mpcfill). It comes with a few nice perks, and you give me the ability to spend more time on these
awesome apps! If you'd like to support these projects, but Patreon isn't your thing, feel free to buy me a coffee [via Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=D96NBC6ZAJ8H6). 
Thank you so much to all my awesome supporters!
